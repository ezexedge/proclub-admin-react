              Custom Pages for Free

            <Typography paragraph>
              Based on our experience in developing applications user interfaces
              we chose popular niche areas for the dashboard pages, applications
              and management sections. We understand that these might not be
              enough for your app's needs. That's why we are offering to build
              custom pages based on your needs, if we feel that your requested
              page design might benefit multiple customers or if they aren't too
              specific to a particular products niche.
            </Typography>
            <Typography paragraph>
              All you have to do is email us at support@bloomui.freshdesk.com
              with a wireframe, prototype or design for the requested pages.
              After our initial review, we will contact you and let you know if
              we'll be integrating your custom page in Tokyo React Admin
              Dashboard.
